Signal is a information carrying waveform. Rarely the channel were the signal propagates is completely preserving the signal as it was sent. Obstacles causes scattering which causes the signal to propagate trough multple paths. Sum of the signal coming from these paths is shifted in ampltide and phase. Phenomena is called fading. Knowing the statistics of the fading is crucial in order to decode signal succesfully.
